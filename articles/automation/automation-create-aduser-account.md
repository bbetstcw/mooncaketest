# Authenticate Runbooks with Azure classic deployment and Resource Manager
This article describes the steps you must perform to configure an Azure AD User account for Azure Automation runbooks running against Azure classic deployment model or Azure Resource Manager resources.  While this continues to be a supported authentication identity for your Azure Resource Manager based runbooks, the recommended method is using an Azure Run As account.       

## Create a new Azure Active Directory user
1. Log in to the Azure Classic Management Portal as a service administrator for the Azure subscription you want to manage.
2. Select **Active Directory**, and then select the name of your organization directory.
3. Select the **Users** tab, and then, in the command area, select **Add User**.
4. On the **Tell us about this user** page, under **Type of user**, select **New user in your organization**.
5. Enter a user name.  
6. Select the directory name that is associated with your Azure subscription on the Active Directory page.
7. On the **user profile** page, provide a first and last name, a user-friendly name, and User from the **Roles** list.  Do not **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication**.
8. Note the user's full name and temporary password.
9. Select **Settings > Administrators > Add**.
10. Type the full user name of the user that you created.
11. Select the subscription that you want the user to manage.
12. Log out of Azure and then log back in with the account you just created. You will be prompted to change the user's password.

## Create an Automation account in Azure Classic Management Portal
In this section, you perform the following steps to create an Azure Automation account in the Azure Classic Management Portal for use with your runbooks managing resources in Azure classic deployment.  

1. Log in to the Azure Classic Management Portal as a service administrator for the Azure subscription you want to manage.
2. Select **Automation**.
3. On the **Automation** page, select **Create an Automation Account**.
4. In the **Create an Automation Account** box, type in a name for your new Automation account and select a **Region** from the drop-down list.  
5. Click **OK** to accept your settings and create the account.
6. After it is created it will be listed on the **Automation** page.
7. Click on the account and it will bring you to the Dashboard page.  
8. On the Automation Dashboard page, select **Assets**.
9. On the **Assets** page, select **Add Settings** located at the bottom of the page.
10. On the **Add Settings** page, select **Add Credential**.
11. On the **Define Credential** page, select **Windows PowerShell Credential** from the **Credential Type** drop-down list and provide a name for the credential.
12. On the following **Define Credential** page type in the username of the AD user account created earlier in the **User Name** field and the password in the **Password** and **Confirm Password** fields. Click **OK** to save your changes.

## Use the credential in a runbook
You can retrieve the credential in a runbook using the [Get-AutomationPSCredential](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn940015.aspx) activity and then use it with [Add-AzureAccount](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn722528.aspx) to connect to your Azure subscription. If the credential is an administrator of multiple Azure subscriptions, then you should also use [Select-AzureSubscription](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn495203.aspx) to specify the correct one. This is shown in the sample Windows PowerShell below that will typically appear at the top of most Azure Automation runbooks.

    $cred = Get-AutomationPSCredential -Name "myuseraccount.partner.onmschina.cn"
    Add-AzureAccount -Environment AzureChinaCloud -Credential $cred
    Select-AzureSubscription -SubscriptionName "My Subscription"

You should repeat these lines after any [checkpoints](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn469257.aspx#bk_Checkpoints) in your runbook. If the runbook is suspended and then resumes on another worker, then it will need to perform the authentication again.
