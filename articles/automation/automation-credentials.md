# Credential assets in Azure Automation
An Automation credential asset holds a [PSCredential](http://msdn.microsoft.com/zh-cn/library/system.management.automation.pscredential)  object which contains security credentials such as a username and password. Runbooks may use cmdlets that accept a PSCredential object for authentication, or they may extract the username and password of the PSCredential object to provide to some application or service requiring authentication. The properties for a credential are stored securely in Azure Automation and can be accessed in the runbook with the [Get-AutomationPSCredential](http://msdn.microsoft.com/zh-cn/library/system.management.automation.pscredential.aspx) activity.

> [!NOTE]
> Secure assets in Azure Automation include credentials, certificates, connections, and encrypted variables. These assets are encrypted and stored in the Azure Automation using a unique key that is generated for each automation account. This key is encrypted by a master certificate and stored in Azure Automation. Before storing a secure asset, the key for the automation account is decrypted using the master certificate and then used to encrypt the asset.  

## Windows PowerShell cmdlets
The cmdlets in the following table are used to create and manage automation credential assets with Windows PowerShell.  They ship as part of the [Azure PowerShell module](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azureps-cmdlets-docs) which is available for use in Automation runbooks.

| Cmdlets | Description |
|:--- |:--- |
| [Get-AzureAutomationCredential](http://msdn.microsoft.com/zh-cn/library/dn913781.aspx) |Retrieves information about a credential asset. You can only retrieve the credential itself from **Get-AutomationPSCredential** activity. |
| [New-AzureAutomationCredential](http://msdn.microsoft.com/zh-cn/library/azure/jj554330.aspx) |Creates a new Automation credential. |
| [Remove- AzureAutomationCredential](http://msdn.microsoft.com/zh-cn/library/azure/jj554330.aspx) |Removes an Automation credential. |
| [Set- AzureAutomationCredential](http://msdn.microsoft.com/zh-cn/library/azure/jj554330.aspx) |Sets the properties for an existing Automation credential. |

## Runbook activities
The activities in the following table are used to access credentials in a runbook.

| Activities | Description |
|:--- |:--- |
| Get-AutomationPSCredential |Gets a credential to use in a runbook. Returns a [System.Management.Automation.PSCredential](http://msdn.microsoft.com/zh-cn/library/system.management.automation.pscredential) object. |

> [!NOTE]
> You should avoid using variables in the -Name parameter of Get-AutomationPSCredential since this can complicate discovering dependencies between runbooks and credential assets at design time.

## Creating a new credential asset

### To create a new credential asset with the Azure Classic Management Portal
1. From your automation account, click **Assets** at the top of the window.
2. At the bottom of the window, click **Add Setting**.
3. Click **Add Credential**.
4. In the **Credential Type** dropdown, select **PowerShell Credential**.
5. Complete the wizard and click the checkbox to save the new credential.

### To create a new credential asset with Windows PowerShell
The following sample commands show how to create a new automation credential. A PSCredential object is first created with the name and password and then used to create the credential asset. Alternatively, you could use the **Get-Credential** cmdlet to be prompted to type in a name and password.

    $user = "MyDomain\MyUser"
    $pw = ConvertTo-SecureString "PassWord!" -AsPlainText -Force
    $cred = New-Object -TypeName System.Management.Automation.PSCredential -ArgumentList $user, $pw
    New-AzureAutomationCredential -AutomationAccountName "MyAutomationAccount" -Name "MyCredential" -Value $cred

## Using a PowerShell credential
You retrieve a credential asset in a runbook with the **Get-AutomationPSCredential** activity. This returns a [PSCredential object](http://msdn.microsoft.com/zh-cn/library/system.management.automation.pscredential.aspx) that you can use with an activity or cmdlet that requires a PSCredential parameter. You can also retrieve the properties of the credential object to use individually. The object has a property for the username and the secure password, or you can use the **GetNetworkCredential** method to return a [NetworkCredential](http://msdn.microsoft.com/zh-cn/library/system.net.networkcredential.aspx) object that will provide an unsecured version of the password.

### Textual runbook sample
The following sample commands show how to use a PowerShell credential in a runbook. In this example, the credential is retrieved and its username and password assigned to variables.

    $myCredential = Get-AutomationPSCredential -Name 'MyCredential'
    $userName = $myCredential.UserName
    $securePassword = $myCredential.Password
    $password = $myCredential.GetNetworkCredential().Password
